- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **Vite.js**: A fast build tool that provides a smooth development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without leaving your HTML.
